**Introduction to Spring Framework:**

Spring Framework is a comprehensive, open-source framework for building enterprise-level Java applications. Developed by Pivotal Software, Spring simplifies the development of complex, scalable, and maintainable applications by providing a robust infrastructure for various concerns such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and data access.

**Need for Spring:**

1. **Simplified Development:** Spring promotes a modular and loosely coupled approach to building applications, making development more manageable and scalable.

2. **Dependency Injection (DI):** One of the core features of Spring, DI facilitates the wiring of components and promotes inversion of control, reducing tight coupling between classes.

3. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Spring supports AOP, allowing developers to separate cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management from the main business logic.

4. **Transaction Management:** Spring provides a unified transaction management interface that supports both programmatic and declarative transaction management across various transactional resources.

5. **Data Access:** Spring simplifies database access through its data access abstraction, supporting both JDBC and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate.

6. **Security:** Spring Security offers comprehensive authentication, authorization, and protection against common security vulnerabilities.

7. **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Spring MVC is a powerful framework for building flexible and scalable web applications.

**Example: Dependency Injection in Spring:**

Let's create a simple example to illustrate the concept of dependency injection in Spring.

**1. Project Setup:**

Create a new Maven project and add the necessary Spring dependencies to the `pom.xml` file.

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
        <version>5.3.10</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**2. Create a Service Interface:**

Create a simple interface to represent the service.

```java
public interface MyService {
    void performAction();
}
```

**3. Create Service Implementations:**

Create two service implementations, each annotated with `@Service`.

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyServiceImpl1 implements MyService {
    @Override
    public void performAction() {
        System.out.println("Action performed by MyServiceImpl1");
    }
}
```

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyServiceImpl2 implements MyService {
    @Override
    public void performAction() {
        System.out.println("Action performed by MyServiceImpl2");
    }
}
```

**4. Create a Configuration Class:**

Create a configuration class with methods annotated with `@Bean` to define beans.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyClient myClient(MyService myService) {
        return new MyClient(myService);
    }

    @Bean
    public MyService myService1() {
        return new MyServiceImpl1();
    }

    @Bean
    public MyService myService2() {
        return new MyServiceImpl2();
    }

    @Value("${my.property}")
    private String propertyValue;

    @Bean
    public String propertyValue() {
        return propertyValue;
    }
}
```

In this configuration class, we define three beans (`myClient`, `myService1`, and `myService2`) using `@Bean` annotations. Additionally, a property named `propertyValue` is injected into a bean named `propertyValue` using the `@Value` annotation.

**5. Create MyClient Class:**

Create a client class that depends on the `MyService` bean.

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyClient {

    private final MyService myService;

    public MyClient(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }

    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Executing MyClient");
        myService.performAction();
    }
}
```

**6. Application Properties:**

Ensure you have an `application.properties` file with the following content:

```properties
my.property=Spring is awesome!
```

**7. Main Application:**

Modify the main application class to load the application context and execute the client.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class)) {
            MyClient client = context.getBean(MyClient.class);
            client.execute();

            // Accessing the property value directly from the context
            String propertyValue = context.getBean(String.class);
            System.out.println("Property Value: " + propertyValue);
        }
    }
}
```

**8. Run the Application:**

Execute the `MainApp` class, and you should see the combined output:

```
Executing MyClient
Action performed by MyServiceImpl1
Property Value: Spring is awesome!
```
