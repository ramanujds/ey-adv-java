### JSP Overview:

JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology used in web development to create dynamic, server-side web pages. JSP simplifies the process of developing web applications by allowing developers to embed Java code within HTML pages. Here's a brief overview:

- **Advantages of JSP:**
  - Combines HTML with Java code, making it easy to maintain.
  - Supports reuse of components through custom tags.
  - Encourages the separation of presentation logic from business logic.

- **Example:**
  ```jsp
  <%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <title>JSP Overview</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>Welcome to JSP!</h1>
      <p>Current date and time: <%= new java.util.Date() %></p>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

### Lifecycle of a JSP:

The lifecycle of a JSP involves several phases such as translation, compilation, and execution. Key stages include:

1. **Translation:** JSP pages are translated into servlets by the JSP container.
2. **Compilation:** The generated servlet is compiled into Java bytecode.
3. **Initialization:** The servlet is loaded and initialized.
4. **Request Handling:** The servlet handles client requests.
5. **Destroy:** The servlet is destroyed when it is no longer needed.

### JSP Implicit Objects:

JSP provides a set of implicit objects that are automatically available for use within a JSP page. Examples include `request`, `response`, `session`, `application`, etc. These objects simplify interaction with the underlying servlet environment.

- **Example:**
  ```jsp
  <%
      String username = (String) request.getAttribute("username");
      out.println("Hello, " + username);
  %>
  ```

### JSP Expression Language (EL):

EL simplifies the embedding of dynamic data into JSP pages. It provides a concise and readable syntax for accessing data stored in implicit objects, JavaBeans, and other scopes.

- **Example:**
  ```jsp
  <p>Username: ${user.username}</p>
  ```

### The JSP Action Tags:

JSP action tags are special tags used to perform specific tasks, such as including other files, controlling flow, and working with JavaBeans.

- **Example:**
  ```jsp
  <jsp:include page="header.jsp" />
  ```

### Model View Controller (MVC):

MVC is a design pattern used to separate an application into three interconnected components: Model (data), View (presentation), and Controller (logic). JSP can be part of the View layer in an MVC architecture.

### Using Servlets and JSP Together to Create an MVC Application:

Combining servlets and JSP allows for the development of robust MVC applications. Servlets handle the controller logic, while JSP manages the presentation layer.

- **Example (Servlet):**
  ```java
  // Servlet Controller
  // Handle business logic and interact with models
  ```

- **Example (JSP):**
  ```jsp
  <!-- JSP View -->
  <!-- Display data and handle user interface -->
  ```
